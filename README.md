This project highlights my skills in data analysis through the creation of an interactive dashboard using Power BI, advanced Excel, and SQL. I utilized SQL for data extraction and manipulation, ensuring accuracy and relevance. In Power BI, I developed dynamic visualizations to identify trends and insights, enhancing data storytelling. Advanced Excel functions and pivot tables facilitated in-depth analysis, providing actionable insights for strategic decisions. The user-friendly interface allows stakeholders to navigate easily, empowering them to make informed choices and drive data-driven decision-making, ultimately fostering improved efficiency and business growth.
